## Quiz

### 1. How do we create an address for the anchor program?

a. it’s already generated and hardcode for us, we don’t need to change anything

**b. it’s already generated, but the value is suitable for localnet deployment and should be replaced with a correctly generated address for production**

c. it should be generated with solana-keygen utils on the default location /target/depoly/-keypair.json

d. it’s taken from your default solana account located at ~/.config/solana/id.json

### 2. How to define entrypoint in Anchor?

a. The project will compile, but such function will not be accessible as entrypoint

b. The project will compile, but the function cannot change the program's state

**c. The project will not compile because #[program] requirements are not satisfied**

d. The project will compile, but IDL will not be generated for the function
