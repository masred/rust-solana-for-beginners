# What is cross program invocation and how it works

## Quiz

### 1. Does Solana support calling one program from another?

a. No, you only can pass messages between programs via signed user transaction

b. Yes, but you are limited to 4 calls within your program

**c. Yes, but recursion depth is limited with four recursive calls**

d. No, Solana programs executed isolated due to sea-level parallelization protocol

### 2. What should you do to invoke another program with the derived account?

a. Such invocation should be done via invoke_signed, so PDA is signed by the program

**b. Such a transaction should be signed with the keypair that owns the program account**

c. Invoking another program with the derived account is impossible as such accounts are only mutable by the program itself

d. None of the above

### 3. Which accounts do you need to pass to transfer the SPL token from the user to the program?

**a. Token account, User associated token account, Program associated token account, Token program account**

b. Token account, User account, Program associated token account

c. Token account, User associated token account, Program associated token account

d. Token account, User account, Token program account, Associated Token Account Program account

### 4. Do Solana programs protected from the reentrancy attack?

a. Yes, because of the limitation of the recursive call depth to 4 levels

b. Yes, because only the owner program can modify account data

c. No, but the changes to the state are applied at the end of the transaction and have no intermediate state during CPI

**d. No, but during CPI of another program, you always have to pass your program_id as one of the accounts, so you are aware that you could be called back**
