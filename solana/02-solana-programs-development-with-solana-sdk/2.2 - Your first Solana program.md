# Your first Solana program

## Quiz

### 1. Do Solana programs run natively on the Validator node on transaction execution?

a. Yes, because of the Rust language we can simply compile and run every program with low resource consumption

b. Yes, Solana programs are compiled into LLVM code and then run as executable on the Validator node in the sandbox environment

**c. No, Solana programs are not executable and are ELF binaries that are executed by BPF inside Solana runtime environment**

d. No, Solana programs are executable, but the entry point is defined via “entrypoint!” macro so the Validator node executes that function instead of main

### 2. What is the correct signature of the entry point function?

a. pub fn main(my_program: &Pubkey, list_of_accounts: &[AccountInfo], payload: &[u8],) -> ProgramResult

b. pub fn process_instruction(program_id: Pubkey, accounts: &[AccountInfo], \_instruction_data: &[u8],) -> ProgramResult

c. pub fn process_instruction(program_id: &Pubkey, \_accounts: &[AccountInfo], \_instruction_data: &[u8],) -> Result<(), u8>

**d. All of the above**

### 3. How Solana programs insist an order of the accounts passed to the program?

**a. Solana program expects that accounts are provided in the correct order and fails if not**

b. The client-side provides a mapping between an account and what data will be read from it so Solana program can match what to read by itself

c. For each program client code can generate IDL that provides information about required accounts and their order

d. Accounts could be provided in any order

### 4. How do you read data from the account?

**a. You need to check if an account has the correct ownership and then parse data with the serialization lib like a borsh**

b. Account data are provided serialized so you can just interact with them

c. You need manually read data from the account into a temporary buffer, check that the correct amount of the data was read, and then memcpy to your struct

d. None of the above

### 5. How to run the log streamer?

a. solana streamer

b. solana stream

**c. solana logs**

d. solana log

e. None of the above

### 6. Which crate should I use when writing custom errors?

a. solana_sdk

**b. thiserror**

c. tokio

d. custom_errors

e. Program_test

### 7. How was the greeting counter tested in this step?

a. through routine calls to the necessary functions (standard unit testing)

b. through TestValidator and rpc_client calls

**c. through Program_test**

d. through JavaScript/TypeScript client

e. through deployment and calling with rpc_api

### 8. What is the type of the program_id variable?

**a. Pubkey**

b. Account

c. Program

d. GreetingAccount

e. ProgramTest
