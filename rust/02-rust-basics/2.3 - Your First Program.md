# Your First Program

## Lesson Introduction

In this lesson, you’ll try to create your first Rust application. In practice, you’ll look through some tools, their functions, and usage. Learn some helpful code tips.

## Installing Rust

☝️ To install a Rust toolchain it is recommended to use rustup. The website should show the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Rust editors

You can figure out how good the support for Rust is in your favorite text editor or IDE at areweideyet.com. Assume that you use VSCode, as it is a lightweight cross-platform with good Rust support. VSCode is one of the best writing options, requiring the least work to set up.

## Write and Compile Animation

😀 Let's start with creating a file hello.rs. You may use an editor of your choice and write down with the following contents:

```
fn main () {
    println!("Hello world!");
}
```

👉 Assuming you've installed the Rust compiler through rustc, you can compile and run the program by issuing:

```
$ rustc hello.rs
$ ./hello
Hello, World!
```

## Creating a Rust crate

Instead of invoking the compiler directly, it is more convenient for larger projects to use Cargo to manage your project. Cargo calls rustc for you based on logic built into Cargo and the instructions you give it through configuration files.

Let's find out how to create a Rust application project:

👉1. Run the following command:

```
$ cargo init hello
     Created binary (application) package
```

👉2. Review the output
The previous step will create a

`hallo`

directory with the project configuration in

`Cargo.toml`

and the source code in

`src/main.rs`

👉3. You can compile and run the application by issuing:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (/home/masred/labs/rust-solana-for-beginners/rust/02-rust-basics/hello)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/hello`
Hello, world!
```

🎉 Congratulations, you've created, built and run your first Rust application!

## Lesson Summary

Following the instructions in this lesson will allow you to build your first Rust application. You’ve learned in practice why Rust is considered to be such a popular programming language.
