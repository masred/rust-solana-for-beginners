# Missing Values

## Lesson Introduction

Any useful program has to handle situations where data may be missing or invalid, or external devices or services are down. Rust separates errors into recoverable and irrecoverable errors, based on whether an error can be reasonably handled by the program or not.Quiz

## Missing Values

One of the most frequent kinds of error handling that you will encounter in a program is the one where a value may or may not be available. ☝️ In some programming languages, the possibility of a value missing is allowed implicitly. In Rust, this possibility is encoded through the type system. This makes it so that a programmer will know when to handle a possibly missing value at compile time.

## Lesson Summary

The idea of encoding errors in the return types stem from functional programming languages like Haskell. The `Option<T>` and `Result<T E>` types are inspired by the Maybe<T> and `Either<T E>` monads. There is a danger hidden in learning about this method of error handling: once you know it, you may start to miss it in other programming languages!
