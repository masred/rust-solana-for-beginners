# Generics

## Quiz

### 1. Which of the following is not true? You can use generics to

a. write better abstractions.

b. create functions that accept parameters of which we do not know the exact type.

c. create types with fields of which we do not know the exact type.

**d. write code with better run-time performance than you can without generics.**

### 2. Take a look at the following program:

```
fn subT(left: T, right: T) -> T {
    left - right
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", sub(5, 6))
}
```

### What can you say about this program? Try to also motivate your answer internally.

**a. The program will not compile.**

b. The program will succesfully run and print 1.

c. The program will succesfully run and print -1.

d. The program will panic because we are trying to subtract 6 from 5 leading to a negative number which can not be represented by u32.

### 3. Take a good look at the following code snippet:

```
fn f<A, B>(a: A, b: B) where A == B {
    // body
}
```

### What can you say about this code:

a. This function takes two generic parameters A and B which have to be of the same type.

b. This function takes two generic parameters A and B which have to implement equality.

c. This function will not compile because you can only take one generic parameter, not two.

**d. This function will not compile because the trait bound A == B is not valid syntax.**
