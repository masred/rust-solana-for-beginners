a. the pattern may not cover all possible values of the type of the expression

**b. the pattern must cover all possible values of the type of the expression**

c. the pattern may not cover all possible values of the expression

d. the pattern must cover all possible values of the expression

### 2. The pattern in an if let

**b. there must exist values in the type of the expression not covered by the pattern**

c. all posible values in the type of the expression must be covered by the pattern

### 3. Given the following enumeration definition:

```
enum X {
    A(u8),
    B(i8),
}
```

### If we want to extract the u8 out of a value of type X if the variant is X::A, we can use ...

a. only an if let statement

b. an if or match statement

c. an if, if let, while let or match statement

**d. an if let, while let or match statement**

### 4. What does the following program print?

```
for n in 1..=3 {
match n {
    0 | 1 => print!("a"),
    _ => print!("b"),
    other if other > 2 => print!("c"),
    }
}
```

a. bac

b. bbb

**c. abb**

d. abc

### 5. The author of this book was working on a 3D renderer in Rust in 2019. He programmed something like the following at some point:

```
enum Key { Up, Down, Left, Right };

match Key::Left {
    Up => println!("Jumping"),
    Down => println!("Ducking!"),
    Left => println!("Sliding Left!"),
    Right => println!("Sliding Right!"),
}
```

### What will this program print?

**a. Jumping!**

b. Ducking!

c. Sliding Left!

d. Sliding Right!
